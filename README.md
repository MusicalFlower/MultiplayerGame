# MultiplayerGame
A repository for testing the functionality of a multiplayer Unity game with Mirror and Steamworks.

## Uploading the game to steam
1. Download the folder from this repository.
2. Open Steam Library. In the bottom left, navigate to ADD A GAME > Add a Non-Steam Game...
3. Select Browse and navigate to the MultiplayerGame folder. Double click on executable.
4. Multiplayer Game should now be in the Steam Library. Click on the game and launch it like any other Steam game.

## Hosting a game
After launching the game, there should be a host button. The expected behaviour is to launch the game,
then click the "Host Game" button (note: name of the button is subject to change).
To invite a Steam friend as the host, go to the in-game Steam menu (shift+tab), click on the friend you want to join you, and invite them as normal.
Note that inviting a friend should be done after you are already in the game.

## Joining a game
After the host has started the game, you can request an invite to their game as you normally would in the Steam menu (shift+tab).

## Removing game from Steam Library
To remove the game from the Library, click on the game and go to the settings icon to the right. Navigate to Manage > Remove non-Steam game from your library.
