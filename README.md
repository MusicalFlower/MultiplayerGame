# MultiplayerGame
A repository for testing the functionality of a multiplayer Unity game with Mirror and Steamworks.

## Playing the game
Download the folder from this repository. With Steam open, the game can be played by double clicking the executable. That's it.
If you want to play it from Steam as a Steam game, you can do the following:
1. Open Steam Library. In the bottom left, navigate to ADD A GAME > Add a Non-Steam Game...
2. Select Browse and navigate to the MultiplayerGame folder. Double click on executable. Then select ADD SELECTED PROGRAMS.
3. Multiplayer Game should now be in the Steam Library. Click on the game and launch it like any other Steam game.
You shouldn't need to redo these steps after a Git pull to play the game from Steam.

## Hosting a game
After launching the game, type a name to use in-game and click the "Host Session" button.
To invite anyone to a session, whether you are the host or not, pause the game, copy the join code by clicking the "Copy" button, and give it to the person you want to join.
To invite a Steam friend as the host, go to the in-game Steam menu (shift+tab), click on the friend you want to join you, and invite them as normal.
Note that inviting a Steam friend should be done after you are already in the game session.

## Joining a game
After the host has started the game, type a name to use in-game, click "Join Session," and type/paste a session join code.
You can also request an invite to the host's game in the Steam menu (shift+tab) if you're Steam friends.

## Removing game from Steam Library
To remove the game from the Library, click on the game and go to the settings icon to the right. Navigate to Manage > Remove non-Steam game from your library.
